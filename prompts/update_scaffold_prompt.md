# Prompt: Update Repository Documentation and Agent Playbooks

## Purpose
You are an AI assistant responsible for refreshing the documentation (`docs/`) and agent playbooks (`agents/`) generated by the ai-context scaffolding tool. Your goal is to bring every guide up to date with the latest repository state, fill in placeholder sections, and maintain cross-references between docs and agent instructions.

## Context Gathering Checklist
1. Run `git status -sb` to understand pending changes.
2. Review the latest merged commits or PRs related to documentation, architecture, workflow, or testing.
3. Inspect `package.json`, CI configuration, and any release or roadmap notes stored in the repository.
4. Check `docs/README.md` for the current document map and confirm each guide listed still exists.
5. Identify unresolved `TODO` prompts or sections flagged for human follow-up.

## Update Procedure
1. **Select a Guide**
   - Navigate to `docs/<guide>.md`.
   - Read the YAML front matter (`ai_update_goal`, `required_inputs`, `success_criteria`) and ensure you collect the listed inputs before editing.

2. **Edit the Guide**
   - Keep the YAML front matter intact but update any fields that have changed.
   - Replace every `TODO` prompt with accurate, current information.
   - Refresh examples, tables, and summaries so they reflect the latest repository state.

3. **Cross-Link Updates**
   - Verify that links between docs remain valid.
   - If you add new guides or sections, update `docs/README.md` and the document map table.

4. **Agent Playbook Alignment**
   - For each change in `docs/`, adjust the related `agents/*.md` playbooks.
   - Ensure the "Documentation Touchpoints" list references the relevant guides and accurately describes why they matter.
   - Update collaboration checklists and evidence sections to reflect the latest workflows.

5. **Evidence & Traceability**
   - Note key sources (commit hashes, issues, ADRs) in the "Evidence to Capture" or "AI Update Checklist" summary lines.
   - If anything is ambiguous or requires human follow-up, leave a concise note clearly labelled for maintainers.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Every guideâ€™s `success_criteria` field is satisfied.
- No unresolved `TODO` prompts remain unless they require explicit human input; in such cases, add a comment explaining the dependency.
- Agent playbooks list accurate responsibilities, best practices, and pointer links to the refreshed docs.
- Changes are self-contained, well-formatted Markdown, and reference any new external resources introduced.

## Deliverables
- Updated Markdown files committed to the repository.
- A short changelog or PR description summarizing:
  - Guides touched
  - Key decisions or facts added
  - Evidence links and any pending follow-ups
