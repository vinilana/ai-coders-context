# Project Overview

AI-Coders Context is a scaffolding tool designed to automate the generation and maintenance of documentation and agent playbooks for AI-assisted coding projects. It addresses the challenge of keeping project documentation synchronized with evolving codebases, particularly in AI-driven development where context for agents can quickly become outdated. This tool benefits AI developers, engineering teams building coding assistants, and open-source contributors by streamlining the creation of up-to-date guides, reducing manual effort, and ensuring consistency across docs and agent instructions. Stakeholders include maintainers of AI tooling repositories and domain experts in prompt engineering and software architecture.

## Quick Facts
- Repository: ai-coders-context (AI context scaffolding tool)
- Primary languages detected:
  - .ts (57 files) – Core TypeScript implementation
  - .md (5 files) – Documentation and markdown assets
  - .json (3 files) – Configuration and manifest files
  - .js (1 file) – JavaScript utilities or configs
  - no-extension (1 file) – Miscellaneous assets
- Total files: 67
- Approximate size: 0.43 MB
- Entry point: Run via npm scripts (e.g., `npm run dev` for development mode)
- License: MIT (standard for open-source AI tooling)

## File Structure & Code Organization
- `prompts/` — Directory containing prompt templates and configurations used by the AI scaffolding tool to generate documentation and agent instructions.
- `src/` — TypeScript source files and CLI entrypoints, housing the core logic for scaffolding, context gathering, and update procedures.
- `AGENTS.md` — Top-level file outlining agent playbooks, responsibilities, and collaboration guidelines for AI agents involved in project maintenance.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — Guidelines for contributors, including code standards, pull request processes, and how to extend the scaffolding tool.
- `example-documentation.ts` — Example TypeScript module demonstrating how the tool generates and integrates documentation within codebases.
- `jest.config.js` — Configuration file for Jest, the testing framework used to validate scaffolding outputs and core functionality.
- `LICENSE` — The project's license file, specifying MIT open-source terms for usage and distribution.
- `package-lock.json` — NPM lockfile that pins dependency versions for reproducible builds across environments.
- `package.json` — Project manifest defining dependencies (e.g., TypeScript, Jest), devDependencies, and scripts for building, testing, and running the CLI.
- `README.md` — Main entry-point documentation, providing an overview, quick start instructions, and links to deeper guides.
- `tsconfig.json` — TypeScript compiler configuration, defining module resolution, target ES version, and strict type-checking rules.

## Technology Stack Summary
- **Runtime & Languages**: Node.js (v18+ recommended) with TypeScript for type-safe development.
- **Build Tooling**: NPM for package management; TypeScript compiler (tsc) for transpilation.
- **Linting & Formatting**: Integrated via ESLint and Prettier (configured in package.json), enforced in CI workflows to maintain code quality.
- **Testing**: Jest for unit and integration tests, focusing on scaffolding accuracy and prompt generation.

## Core Framework Stack
- **Backend/CLI Layer**: Custom TypeScript-based CLI using Node.js modules; no heavy frameworks, emphasizing lightweight scaffolding logic.
- **Data & Prompt Layer**: JSON-based configurations for prompts and metadata; architectural patterns include modular prompt injection and context-aware updates.
- **Enforced Patterns**: Follows functional programming principles for agent instructions; uses YAML front matter in docs for structured metadata; ensures idempotent updates to avoid overwriting human-edited content.

## UI & Interaction Libraries
- **CLI Interaction**: Relies on Node.js console APIs and libraries like Commander.js (if present) for argument parsing and user prompts.
- **No Graphical UI**: Pure CLI tool; considerations for accessibility include clear error messages, color-coded outputs (via Chalk), and internationalization via template strings.
- **Design Guidelines**: Outputs follow Markdown standards for readability; agent playbooks use consistent checklists and evidence sections.

## Development Tools Overview
- Essential CLIs: `npm` for installation and scripts; `tsc` for compilation; `jest` for testing.
- Developer Environment: VS Code recommended with TypeScript and Jest extensions; Git for version control.
- Link to [Tooling & Productivity Guide](./tooling.md) for deeper setup instructions, including environment variables and IDE configurations.

## Getting Started Checklist
1. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
2. Explore the CLI by running `npm run dev`.
3. Review [Development Workflow](./development-workflow.md) for day-to-day tasks.

## Next Steps
- Review the [README.md](../README.md) for product positioning and usage examples.
- Explore open issues on the repository's GitHub for roadmap items (e.g., enhanced agent integration).
- Contact stakeholders via GitHub discussions for verification of custom scaffolding needs.
- Key external resources: Node.js docs (nodejs.org) and TypeScript handbook (typescriptlang.org) for foundational specs.

## AI Update Checklist
1. Review roadmap items or issues labelled “release” to confirm current goals.
2. Cross-check Quick Facts against `package.json` and environment docs.
3. Refresh the File Structure & Code Organization section to reflect new or retired modules; keep guidance actionable.
4. Link critical dashboards, specs, or runbooks used by the team.
5. Flag any details that require human confirmation (e.g., stakeholder ownership).
