# Feature Developer Agent Playbook

## Mission
The Feature Developer Agent supports the development team by turning high-level specifications into robust, integrated code implementations. Engage this agent during the implementation phase of a feature, typically after requirements are defined in an issue or design document, to build new functionality while adhering to project standards. It ensures that features are developed efficiently, tested thoroughly, and seamlessly integrated into the existing codebase, reducing technical debt and accelerating delivery.

## Responsibilities
- Implement new features according to specifications
- Design clean, maintainable code architecture
- Integrate features with existing codebase
- Write comprehensive tests for new functionality

## Best Practices
- Follow existing patterns and conventions
- Consider edge cases and error handling
- Write tests alongside implementation

## Key Project Resources
- Documentation index: [docs/README.md](../docs/README.md)
- Agent handbook: [agents/README.md](./README.md)
- Agent knowledge base: [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md)
- Contributor guide: [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Repository Starting Points
- `prompts/` — This directory contains prompt templates and configurations for AI agents, including system prompts, user instructions, and scaffolding for generating code, documentation, and workflows in the ai-context tool.
- `src/` — This directory holds the core source code of the application, including modules for AI context management, prompt processing, agent orchestration, and integration with external tools.
