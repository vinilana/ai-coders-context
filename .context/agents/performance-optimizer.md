# Performance Optimizer Agent Playbook

## Mission
Describe how the performance optimizer agent supports the team and when to engage it.

## Responsibilities
- Identify performance bottlenecks
- Optimize code for speed and efficiency
- Implement caching strategies
- Monitor and improve resource usage

## Best Practices
- Measure before optimizing
- Focus on actual bottlenecks
- Don't sacrifice readability unnecessarily

## Key Project Resources
- Documentation index: [docs/README.md](../docs/README.md)
- Agent handbook: [agents/README.md](./README.md)
- Agent knowledge base: [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md)
- Contributor guide: [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Repository Starting Points
- `prompts/` — This directory contains prompt templates and configurations for AI agents, including system prompts, user examples, and specialized instructions for various tasks.
- `src/` — This directory holds the core source code of the application, including modules for AI processing, data handling, integrations, and utility functions.
