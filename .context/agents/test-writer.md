# Test Writer Agent Playbook

## Mission
Describe how the test writer agent supports the team and when to engage it.

## Responsibilities
- Write comprehensive unit and integration tests
- Ensure good test coverage across the codebase
- Create test utilities and fixtures
- Maintain and update existing tests

## Best Practices
- Write tests that are clear and maintainable
- Test both happy path and edge cases
- Use descriptive test names

## Key Project Resources
- Documentation index: [docs/README.md](../docs/README.md)
- Agent handbook: [agents/README.md](./README.md)
- Agent knowledge base: [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md)
- Contributor guide: [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Repository Starting Points
- `prompts/` — Contains prompt templates and configurations for AI agents, including system prompts, user instructions, and scaffolding definitions used to guide agent behaviors and interactions.
- `src/` — Houses the core source code of the application, including modules for AI context processing, repository analysis, documentation generation, and integration utilities.
