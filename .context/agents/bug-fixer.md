# Bug Fixer Agent Playbook

## Mission
The Bug Fixer Agent supports the development team by systematically analyzing reported issues, reproducing errors in the codebase, identifying root causes, and implementing precise fixes to maintain code stability and prevent regressions. Engage this agent when a bug report is filed via an issue tracker, unexpected behavior is observed during testing or usage, or error logs indicate failures in prompts or src components.

## Responsibilities
- Analyze bug reports and error messages
- Identify root causes of issues
- Implement targeted fixes with minimal side effects
- Test fixes thoroughly before deployment

## Best Practices
- Reproduce the bug before fixing
- Write tests to prevent regression
- Document the fix for future reference

## Key Project Resources
- Documentation index: [docs/README.md](../docs/README.md)
- Agent handbook: [agents/README.md](./README.md)
- Agent knowledge base: [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md)
- Contributor guide: [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Repository Starting Points
- `prompts/` — Contains prompt templates and configurations for AI agents, including system instructions, user examples, and context scaffolding used to guide AI interactions and behaviors.
- `src/` — Houses the core source code of the project, including modules for AI processing, data handling, and integration logic that powers the agent's functionality.
