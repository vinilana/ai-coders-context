 * Scaffold Structure Definitions (DEPRECATED)

 * This file is maintained for backward compatibility.
 * All functionality has been moved to the ./structures/ module.
 *
 * New code should import from './structures' instead.
 *
 * Old import: import { getScaffoldStructure } from './scaffoldStructures';
 * New import: import { getScaffoldStructure } from './structures';

// Re-export everything from the new modular structure
export * from './structures';
